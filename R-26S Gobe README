The R-26S Gobe glider has been divided into 2 files due to file size constraints, download both the main zip and the paint zip, then decompress bothe files and place the 2 paint files in the main file of the Gobe.
please note in XP11.40 you will have to turn down the texture slider in graphics to medium or below to have a clear canopy, higher settings will cause the canopt to turn dark.
