# X-Plane-vintage-gliders-for-XP11.40
some vintage and not so vintage sailplanes brought up to XP.11.40. All have beem modified, some more than others. A few have 3D cockpits most will have 2D.
On all the gliders I have added a simple compensated vario with both volume control and sample rate (sensitivity) selection. volume is 1-4, sample rates go from 25 300 in .50 increments.
Some models have the garmin 530 nav panel, others 430. the older vintage ships don't have navigation. The Garmins of course are not glider specific instruments, but allow one to load a task (flight plan). and see the route on the GPS moving map. It will also give you single and combined distances between waypoints.
On the Grobs,  ASW-15, ASH25 I added updated sounds to landing roll (both tarmac and turf), retract sound where applicable, spoilers, and wind and rain sounds.
I redesigned and in 2 cases re-touched the panels in Photoshop in order to shift gauges around. adding some instruments and deleting others. On  the Grobs, I corrected the main wheel hanging below the fuselage.
Several of these have very good object modeling perhaps worthy of further development, The Grobs have so so models, but include 3 D cockpits. All other just have 2D cockpits.
I brought these up through in some cases XP 9, and 10 planemaker.
