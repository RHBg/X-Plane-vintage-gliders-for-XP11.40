# X-Plane-vintage-gliders-for-XP11.40
some vintage and not so vintage sailplanes brought up to XP.11.40. Some have beem modified, others are as is. A few have 3D cockpits most will have 2D.
On some of the more modern types, I have added a simple compensated vario with both volume control and sample rate (sensitivity) selection. volume is 1-4, sample rates go from 25 300 in .50 increments.
Some models have the garmin 560 nav panel, while not sailplane specific, you can load tasks and follow your route on the moving map, track waypoints, times  etc. better than nothing.
